# Documentation

If you want to start exploring the (early) features of HouseMon, keep these  
points in mind and check <http://jeelabs.org/tag/housemon/> for the latest news:

* the "logger" triggers on "incoming" events, as emitted by the "rf12demo" briq
* the "Readings" page needs drivers and mappings from node ID to that driver
* the "Status" page also needs mappings from node ID's to named locations
* the "archiver" and "history" briqs use status changes, so get that going first
* the "Graphs" page only works off history data so far, i.e. up to 48 hours back

There is some documentation in the `docs/` folder, but things *do* change fast!
